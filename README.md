Entomophagy is defined as "the practice of eating insects, especially by people."

While this may sound discusting, entomophagy is actually a common practice around other cuntries around the world.

With very few restaurants selling insects in the USA, I created the landing page for an imaginary restaurant called **Entomo Kitchen**, allong with the menu page.
